Briefly About Myself:
---------------------
I am a student of a Belarusian-Russian university. I am entered the university without any experience of programming and after 2 years of studying here, I can definitely say that I master most programming languages ​​​​with ease and I am always ready to learn something new.  
  
I can say that I enjoy coding in backend because it is much more easier for me than do some things with user interface: colors, shapes, styles, animations, etc. But no matter what anyone says, often a fullstack programmer is much more in demand than regular one.  
  
So that is why i began studying front-end languages. And I am sure that I will succeed in becoming good fullstack programmer.

Code example

**Work with strings KATA from Codewars:**
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
  
  using System;

    public class Kata
    {
      public static string AreYouPlayingBanjo(string name) 
      {
        if(name.StartsWith('R') || name.StartsWith('r'))
        {
          return name + " plays banjo";
        }
        return name + " does not play banjo";
      }
